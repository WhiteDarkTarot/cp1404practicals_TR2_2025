# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates gradually improved throughout the semester. At first, I often underestimated how long it would take, especially for tasks that involved unfamiliar concepts. But as I gained experience, my estimates became more realistic.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

During the course, my ability to estimate task durations improved as I gained more knowledge about the factors that affect task complexity. This helped me better plan and manage my time.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I realized how important it is to break down tasks before evaluating and considering possible setbacks such as debugging and researching new topics. It taught me discipline in time management and allowed me to track my progress better.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Participating in code reviews has taught me the importance of writing clear, maintainable code. Getting feedback has helped me identify areas in my code that could be improved for readability or efficiency, and I have also learned to actively accept constructive criticism.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Code review has given me new perspectives and programming skills. It has improved my attention to detail and helped me better understand coding practices by analyzing other people's code structure and logic.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 06](https://github.com/WhiteDarkTarot/cp1404practicals_TR2_2025/pull/3)

### Explanation

In this review, I found some defects early in the process and corrected them before pushing to GitHub. Afterwards, I asked my classmates to review the commits to confirm that the issues were resolved. This shows that I am proactive in quality inspection and seeking feedback to ensure the reliability of the code.

### Good Code Review 2

[prac 08](https://github.com/WhiteDarkTarot/cp1404practicals_TR2_2025/pull/5)

### Explanation

During this review, I made sure that my code met the requirements and remained clear. After personally verifying it, I also invited a classmate to participate in the review process, and they confirmed that no major issues were found. This showed the team's collaborative spirit and confidence in maintaining good code quality.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge, I would add more collaborative elements to the practical tasks to simulate a real programming environment and encourage peer learning. Group tasks and peer programming will provide students with valuable experience and prepare them for industry practice.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I always stay on task and strive to improve the quality of my code with every practice. I also proactively review and improve my code and actively participate in peer feedback to ensure that the code I submit is solid and professional.
